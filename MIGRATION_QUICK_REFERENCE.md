## 🚀 Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (30 min)

### Actions:
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Select your repository
5. **Set Root Directory**: `frontend`
6. Click "Deploy"

### Verify:
```bash
# Visit your Vercel URL
https://__________.vercel.app

# Should load (API calls will fail - that's OK for now)
```

### Files Ready:
✅ `frontend/vercel.json`
✅ `frontend/.gitignore`

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Deploy Backend to Render (45 min)

### Actions:
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Select your repository
5. **Set Root Directory**: `backend`
6. **Build Command**: `npm install`
7. **Start Command**: `npm start`
8. **Add Environment Variables** (see below)
9. Click "Create Web Service"

### Environment Variables:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your-key
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
TRUST_PROXY=true
GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT=100
```

### Verify:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://nacos-backend.onrender.com/api/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### Files Ready:
✅ `backend/render.yaml`
✅ `backend/.gitignore`

---

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend (20 min)

### Find Your API Config:
Look for: `frontend/assets/js/api-config.js` or similar

### Update API URL:
```javascript
// CHANGE THIS:
const API_URL = 'https://old-railway-url.up.railway.app/api';

// TO THIS:
const API_URL = 'https://nacos-backend.onrender.com/api';
```

### Deploy Changes:
```bash
cd frontend
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update API URL to Render"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys in 30-60 seconds
```

### Verify:
```javascript
// In browser console on your Vercel site:
fetch(window.API_URL + '/events/upcoming')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('✅ Working!', d))
  .catch(e => console.error('❌ Failed:', e));
```

## 🆘 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: CORS Errors
**Fix:**
1. Check `FRONTEND_URL` in Render matches Vercel URL exactly
2. No trailing slashes!
3. Restart Render service

### Issue: Vercel Site Blank
**Fix:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General
2. Check "Root Directory" = `frontend`
3. Redeploy

### Issue: Render "Application failed to respond"
**Fix:**
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test `npm start` locally

### Issue: Cold Starts (Render Free Tier)
**Expected Behavior:**
- Service sleeps after 15 min of inactivity
- First request takes 30-60s to wake up
- **Fix**: Upgrade to Starter ($7/month) for no cold starts
